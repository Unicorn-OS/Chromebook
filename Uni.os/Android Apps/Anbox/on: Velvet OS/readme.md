*Some notes on getting Anbox running&

Thread: https://github.com/hexdump0815/imagebuilder/issues/57

- CONFIG_ASHMEM, CONFIG_ANDROID and CONFIG_JOYSTICK for anbox - to play android games maybe
- anbox needs some kernel patches for dropped android support in 5.18, will see if it works
- anbox is incompatible with arm64 it seems, dropped that too
